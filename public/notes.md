### Some thoughts on what I've learned from this assignment
- Git is a useful tool for version control
- Commits should be spaced in a sweet spot, every line of code would be excessive, but a full day's work without a commit is dangerous as well.
- Every hour or so, or every stable and complete addition or modification seems like a good way of going about it.

- I learned how to rent an AWS server, and more of how a server works, with it's IP, allocated memory, etc. It seems to me like these servers, instead of being computers, are virtual machines, and most of the same principles apply to them.
